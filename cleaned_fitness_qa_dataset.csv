What is the Dumbbell skier exercise?,"As the name suggests, the dumbbell skier takes the motion of skiing and replaces the poles with dumbbells. The hip and torso motion are similar to a kettlebell swing, as are the muscles it targets, including the hamstrings, glutes, upper back, and grip. However, unlike the traditional kettlebell swing, the arms are outside of the knees. This movement can be performed for time or for reps, but is usually performed for relatively high reps, such as 8-12 sets per rep or more, as part of a fat-loss or athleticism-focused circuit or workout."

What is the Band-assisted chin-up exercise?,"The band-assisted chin-up is a variation of the pull-up exercise in which the reps are performed with the palms facing toward the body in an underhand position, with a band looped around the feet or knees. This reduces weight and resistance at the bottom of the rep, while increasing it toward the top. Like other pull-up variations, it builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core, but it utilizes the biceps slightly more than overhand band-assisted pull-ups."
